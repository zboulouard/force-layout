		// Define the dimensions of the visualization.
			
			var width = 640;
			var height = 480;
			
		// Define the data for the example. In general, a force layout requires two data arrays. The first array, here named `nodes`,
		// contains the object that are the focal point of the visualization.
		// The second array, called `links` below, identifies all the links between the nodes. (The more mathematical term is "edges.")

		// For the simplest possible example we only define two nodes. As far as D3 is concerned, nodes are arbitrary objects. Normally the
		// objects wouldn't be initialized with `x` and `y` properties like
		// we're doing below. When those properties are present, they tell D3 where to place the nodes before the force layout starts its
		// magic. More typically, they're left out of the nodes and D3 picks random locations for each node. We're defining them here so we can
		// get a consistent application of the layout which lets us see the effects of different properties.
			
			var nodes = [
							{ x: width/3, y: height/2 },
							{ x: 2*width/3, y: height/2 }
						];
		
		// The `links` array contains objects with `source` and `target` property which are the indices in the `nodes` array of the two endpoints of the link.
			
			var links = [
							{ source: 0, target: 1 }
						];
			
		// Here's where the code begins. We start off by creating an SVG container to hold the visualization.
		
			var svg = d3.select("body")
							.append("svg")
							.attr("width", width)
							.attr("height", height);
		
		// Now we create a force layout object and define its properties.
		
			var force = d3.layout.force()
									.size([width, height])
									.nodes(nodes)
									.links(links);
		
		// There's one more property of the layout we need to define, its `linkDistance`. That's generally a configurable value and,
		// for a first example, we'd normally leave it at its default.
		// Unfortunately, the default value results in a visualization that's not especially clear. This parameter defines the distance (normally in pixels) 
		// that we'd like to have between nodes that are connected. (It is, thus, the length we'd like our links to have.)
		
			force.linkDistance(width/2);
		
		// The order MUST be respected Links then Nodes
		
			var link = svg.selectAll(".link")
							.data(links)
							.enter()
								.append("line")
								.attr("class", "link");
		
			var node = svg.selectAll(".node")
							.data(nodes)
							.enter()
								.append("circle")
								.attr("class", "node");
			
		// We're about to tell the force layout to start its calculations. We do, however, want to know when those calculations are complete, so before we kick 
		// things off we'll define a function that we want the layout to call once the calculations are done.
		
			force.on('end', function() {
				
	    // When this function executes, the force layout calculations have concluded. The layout will have set various properties in our nodes and
	    // links objects that we can use to position them within the SVG container.
	    
		// First let's reposition the nodes. As the force layout runs it updates the `x` and `y` properties that define where the node should be centered.
	    // To move the node, we set the appropriate SVG attributes to their new values. We also have to give the node a non-zero radius so that it's visible
	    // in the container.
	    
			node.attr('r', width/25)
	        	.attr('cx', function(d) { return d.x; })
	        	.attr('cy', function(d) { return d.y; });
	    
		// We also need to update positions of the links. For those elements, the force layout sets the `source` and `target` properties, specifying
	    // `x` and `y` values in each case.
	    
			link.attr('x1', function(d) { return d.source.x; })
	        	.attr('y1', function(d) { return d.source.y; })
	        	.attr('x2', function(d) { return d.target.x; })
	        	.attr('y2', function(d) { return d.target.y; });

		// Okay, everything is set up now so it's time to turn things over to the force layout. Here we go.
